          New opportunities for Life Equality Chances
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is true, that many people are enjoying new opportunities provided
          by globalization! That is mainly in the aspect of communication where
          people around the world are sharing information instantaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, opportunities for people's better live still remain a dream for
          many because of lack of necessary conditions for that. Yes, life
          equality chances is possible, as long as there is a strategy to
          implement it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that globalization provides life equality chances to all is
          not evident up now. The lack of true collaboration among countries or
          regions seems to be a barrier. This project will be evident when a
          common interest will prevalece.
